# Social Code
A social network for software developers.

## Inspiration 
There is no complete social network for software developers. Stack Overflow is very forum-based and not very social. Github lacks news feeds. Facebook is too generic. CodePen is more a playground for code snippets.

Social Code incorporates a news feed of posts from followers. Posts can be status updates, code snippets, and article links. Users can like and comment on posts. There is a sidebar with the latest tech articles for easy access. 

## Features
- Follow users and their posts
- Post and save useful code snippets
- Search Stack Overflow for questions
- Direct message other users
- Stay up-to-date on latest tech news
